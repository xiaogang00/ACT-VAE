This is a pytorch project for the paper [**Conditional Temporal Variational AutoEncoder for Action Video Prediction**]


## Introduction

To synthesize a realistic action sequence based on a single human image, it is crucial to model both motion patterns and diversity in the action video.
This paper proposes an Action Conditional Temporal Variational AutoEncoder (ACT-VAE) to improve motion prediction accuracy and capture movement diversity.
ACT-VAE predicts pose sequences for an action clips from a single input image. It is implemented as a deep generative model that maintains temporal coherence according to the action category with a novel temporal modeling on latent space. Further, ACT-VAE is a general action sequence prediction framework. When connected with a plug-and-play Pose-to-Image (P2I) network, ACT-VAE can synthesize image sequences. Extensive experiments bear out our approach can predict accurate pose and synthesize realistic image sequences, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.
Compared to existing methods, ACT-VAE improves model accuracy and preserves diversity.

## Project Setup

First install Python 3. We advise you to install Python 3 and PyTorch with Anaconda:

```
conda create --name py36 python=3.6
source activate py36
```

Clone the repo and install the complementary requirements:
```
cd $HOME
git clone --recursive git@github.com:xiaogang00/ACT-VAE.git
cd ACT-VAE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prepare dataset:
- Download Penn dataset from http://dreamdragon.github.io/PennAction and store it in one path.
- the training sequences with their action ids, pose information and mask information are stored in training_pair_penn5.txt and testing_pair_penn5.txt, please modify the corresponding paths of images.

## Training

To train the ACT-VAE

```
python train_actvae.py --config config/Penn_actvae.yaml --name _test
```

To train the P2I network

```
python train_actvae_p2inetwork.py --config config/Penn_actvae_p2inetwork.yaml --name _generate --vae_path outputs/Penn_actvae/checkpoints
```


## Testing

To synthesize the pose sequence with ACT-VAE

```
python train_actvae.py --config config/Penn_actvae.yaml --name _test --test --resume
```

To synthesize the image sequence with ACT-VAE and P2I network
